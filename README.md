# OpenCV Face Detection

This repository contains a project that implements human face detection using OpenCV in a Windows environment. The application captures video from a camera, processes the frames to detect faces, and renders the results on a window.

## Functionality
- Loads configuration settings from a config file.
- Initializes a window for displaying video feed.
- Captures video frames from a specified camera.
- Uses a pre-trained cascade classifier to detect faces in the video frames.
- Draws rectangles around detected faces and displays the processed video feed.

## Tech Stack
- **C++**: The primary programming language used for the application.
- **OpenCV**: Utilized for video capture and face detection.
- **Windows API**: Used for creating and managing the application window.
- **OpenGL**: Used for rendering the video feed.
- **Config Loader**: Custom utility for loading configuration settings.
